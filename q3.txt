Q3: You are tasked to build an application that can summarize long documents in both
English and Malay.

How would you approach this problem? In your answer, cover:

1. Preprocessing steps you’d consider,
2. How you’d handle multilingual support (including possible code-switching),
3. The approach for summarization (extractive vs abstractive, model choice, or LLM
usage),
4. How you would evaluate the quality of the summaries.


1. Preprocessing steps
- extract text from document
- clean text by removing extra whitespace, new lines, to reduce input token
- split text into chunks with overlap by using text splitter, for example RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

2. handle multilingual support (including possible code-switching), approach for summarization (extractive vs abstractive, model choice, or LLM
usage)

Idetify primary language
- check first 3 chunks to identify the primary language. Choose model that knows Malay and English well for example, ILMU
prompt:
"Identify the primary language of this text. Return only the name of the language (e.g., 'English', 'Malay', Text: {text}"

- summarize each chunk independently in primary language, using abstractive summarization rewrite it with same meaning, which can preserve meaning and concise

prompt:
"The input text may contain a mix of English and Malay. Provide a concise, abstractive summary in {language}.
Text: {chunk}"

- combine all the chunk summaries and summarize again, Force single-language output, remove redundancy

prompt:
"The following is a list of summaries for the same document:
{summaries}

Task:
1. Combine these into a single, cohesive abstractive summary.
2. REMOVE REDUNDANCY: If multiple summaries mention the same fact, include it only once.
3. OUTPUT LANGUAGE: You must write the final summary entirely in {language}."

- post processing, format (bullet points/ paragraphs ...)
prompt:
"You are a professional editor. Take the following summary and format it for a corporate report.

final summary:
{final_summary}

FORMATTING RULES:
1. Use a bold Title at the top.
2. Provide a 2-3 sentence Overview paragraph
3. Use a 'Key Takeaways' section with bullet points for the main facts.
4. End with a 'Conclusion' paragraph.
5. All output must be in {language}."


3. How you would evaluate the quality of the summaries
- Use prompt constraints (do not add new facts, summarize only provided text, preserve numbers and names)
- LLM-as-a-Judge approach, use another LLM as evaluator to grade responses against specific criteria for example, factual accuracy, entity preservation, hallucination
